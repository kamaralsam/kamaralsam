**✨ Hi, I’m Kamar Alsamerraey!**

I’m a Master’s in Computer Science student (Dec 2026) with a background in healthcare, education, and digital design, now transitioning into AI, QA automation, and data-focused tech roles.
I love building practical tools, documenting processes clearly, and creating projects that genuinely help people — especially in healthcare and education.

**💡 What I’m Focusing on Right Now**

Building “Moonlight OET” — an AI-powered assistant for healthcare professionals preparing for the OET exam (LLM reasoning, retrieval, structured feedback)

QA Automation using Selenium + Python + pytest

Data Analytics (Python, Pandas, SQL) + healthcare-focused analysis projects

Preparing for ISTQB Foundation Level

Growing a clean, professional GitHub portfolio with real-world examples

Strengthening my UI/UX skills in Figma, building mockups for early-stage products

**🧠 Technical Skills**

Languages: Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, Markdown
QA & Automation: Selenium, pytest, test case design, API testing (Requests), manual + exploratory testing
AI/LLM: Prompt engineering, OpenAI API, RAG concepts, evaluation
